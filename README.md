Like my cavestory project, this will be another project in the 
creation of games. I will be working on both to get a better
understanding of how game development works.

I will be using the Handmade Penguin guide first, since that covers
the Linux environment while the tutorial online covers the Windows
environment.

Finished with the SDL window. Put that into the game.cpp.
